# password-generator-HM

This project is a password generator; it is a useful tool to generate a strong password to your liking. This project was built because I was tired of coming up with my passwords. This project will help you develop a password that will include Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, and Symbols that can be 8-128 characters long. Learning Javascript is complicated. Doing this project helped me understand just how each function and how DOM Elements work together.
